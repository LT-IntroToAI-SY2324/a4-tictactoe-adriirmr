# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
The most difficult part to tic-tac-toe is assigning the classes and implementing them with the code. The game of tic tac toe itself has a few rules, such as how both players need to wait on the others move, and the way that these turns were shown was trough the return of whether the move is 'false' or 'true'. I thought that coding this is hard, because a small mistake or order can make the game not function right and give out an error. 



2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
The way that you would add a computer player to the game is by making a new class to make the computer player appear. After creating the player as an object in the class, you need to bring the player to the game and you would do this by calling the computer player class to the game and code.

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.

If I add a computer player I might get the computer player to play the best move every time by maybe using or implementing an outside software or program that already has this strategy of knowing the best move and combining it with the code. Another option would be to maybe program it and do it yourself by coding the computer to block any moves the opposing payer could make, such as by programming the computer player to always place a X o O next to the player moce.
